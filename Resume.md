My resume can be summarized as follows:

1. Empathy, Passionate and Honored.
2. Close to User.
3. Collecting Feedback and Improving Products.

I am [Zhiyuan Ju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjzhiyuan/), 26 years old (July 1997), and I’m frequently traveling between China and Singapore in 2023.

I have been writing blog posts in Mandarin Chinese since 2015. However, in early 2022, I decided to switch to writing in English because I am responsible for building a global team at [API7.ai](http://api7.ai/). English is easier for both me and my team members to communicate and share ideas. (In June, I switched to Substack to publish monthly newsletter)

My team is growing stronger with Developer Advocates, Global Growth, Docs, and Customer Success, and I really appreciate their work:

1. Everyone is positive with clear goals.
2. We exchange necessary information and discuss regularly.
3. We try to overcome gaps due to different cultures when understanding the same question.
4. We encourage every Chinese member of [API7.ai](http://api7.ai/) to use English to communicate, and it has been successful after months.

So I don't need to micromanage, and I can share what we have done, what we are doing, why we need to do it, and how the results are performing with honor.

Between 2015 and 2022, I spent most of my time Connecting with Developers in the open source community:

1. Help developers onboard via remote meetings.
2. Connect with developers to collect use cases, pain points, and improvement suggestions.
3. Forward feedback to committers and PMC members for discussion.
4. Put confirmed plans onto the roadmap.

I have communicated with more than 400+ developers and solution/enterprise architects from 2021 to 2022 Q2. Just ask them and try to [schedule a quick call](https://meetings.hubspot.com/zhiyuan) is an efficient way to learn about each other, understand what they want to achieve, support them in using the products, and encourage them to share feedback and use cases. 

After Q2 2022, I began to put 67% or more of my focus on Customer Success, and 22% on Generating Leads. I have built a separate team dedicated to this purpose with R&D, PM, and Sales. Unlike helping each developer with a different technical background to onboard and use [Apache APISIX](https://api7.ai/apisix), at this stage, my focus turns to users who are going into production or looking for commercial support. This is a long story to share because, after hundreds of meetings with real customers, we are clearer on how they use our products, why they do so, and what we can offer them. This is a win-win situation for both customers and us.

## Highlights

1. Helped four non-computer majors find jobs by learning Web technology between 2020 and 2022, one of them is working with me at [API7.ai](http://API7.ai).
2. Donate one M1 at my expense to one of the Indian contributors to participate in the open-source community in 2021.

6. Support Developers and Customers Success on using Apache APISIX and API7 Enterprise Edition: Discuss and Review Architecture Design, Deployment Proposal, PoC, Going for Production, Monitoring for System Running, and so on.
7. Plan and design Apache APISIX new documentation structure with team, review changes, and collect feedback from community developers.
8. Responsible for the SEO optimization of the [APISIX website](https://apisix.apache.org), optimizing keywords, output quality content, building internal links, and increasing backlinks with the team, achieving a 331% increase in visitors compared to last year (Oct 2021 ~ Oct 2022).

## Timeline

- In Sep 2015, I started my university journey.
- In 2016, I met many friends from university or offline events with the same passion for challenges.
- In 2017, I was involved in [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) with [Miya Liu](https://twitter.com/miyaliu666) to host events and encourage people to learn Web technologies.
- In Mar 2018, I went to Frankfurt am Main as an exchange student.
- In July 2018, I interned as a web developer at Netease (a.k.a [163.com](http://163.com/)).
- In late 2018, I started my first remote work as a full-stack web engineer in Team247, a startup to build or maintain software for US clients (e.g., Visa, Bee On Demand). Even though I was still in university, the challenges and tasks were indeed for Senior Engineers. But I enjoyed this because I was not treated as an intern only but did things as other experienced engineers. So I learned a lot from here.
- In June 2019, I graduated from university and started as a full stack web engineer to build one stream media platform in the WeChat ecosystem. It’s super exciting to see many users watching videos on our platform, and we also got paid for ads.
- In July 2019, the [APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix) creators contacted me to check if I was interested in contributing to APISIX projects in my spare time. Of course! Then my story started from here. I summarize the story in the past 3 years into blogs: [My Story with the Apache Software Foundation](https://gist.github.com/juzhiyuan/18c5485cd29262a5795a432807cf2655) and [Things worth sharing over the two years of startup](https://gist.github.com/juzhiyuan/4cf1bff0b993ebb816d53650d6dabe1a)
- Between May 2020 and Nov 2021, I acted as a community maintainer in the Apache APISIX community. To help beginners onboard, to highlight contributors to encourage them, to collect feedback from community users, to apply feedback as product/docs improvements, etc.
- Acted as a mentor in OSPP 2020 and 2021 to guide Chinese students to contribute to open-source projects.
- Acted as a mentor in GSoC 2020 and 2021 to guide global students onboard and learn from open source.
- Between Dec 2021 and 2022, I turned to focus on those things: Setting up Global Team in [API7.ai](http://api7.ai/), tracking potential customer leads from community users, supporting community users to use APISIX well, support customers for production, collecting feedback and applying improvements as before, to work with advocates on Developer Experience on Q4.
- Between Q3 2022 and Q2 2023 (until now), I put more effort and focus on Customer Success by supporting and training their Engineering team on system architecture design, deployment review, configuration changes review, online debugging.
