# Minima

This project was originally a Hugo port of the [Hexo Minima](https://github.com/adisaktijrs/hexo-theme-minima). A lot of changes have been made so far to make Minima cooler.

## Usage

Before using Minima, make sure you've got Hugo (extended version) installed on your device.

### Installation

Suppose `blog` is where you place your sources.

```bash
cd blog
git init
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/mivinci/hugo-theme-minima.git themes/minima
```

Or  `clone` directly if you don't wanna use the Git submodule.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mivinci/hugo-theme-minima.git themes/minima
```

Anyways, you just need to put Minima under the `blog/themes` directory.

### Configuration

Follow [exampleSite/config.toml](https://github.com/Mivinci/hugo-theme-minima/blob/main/exampleSite/config.toml) and edit your own `blog/config.toml` file.

### External Link Post

Use the `link` in the front matter to make a post a specific external link. Such external link post will redirect to the link provided.

**Example**

```yaml
---
author: XJJ
title: External Link Post
date: 2021-07-17T10:52:59+08:00
link: https://gohugo.io
---
```

And when you click the title in the list page, you will be redireted to https://gohugo.io, which's ðŸ†’.

### RSS Feeds

v1.1.0 and later versions support subscription to external RSS feeds whereas titles and links to your friends' posts can be displayed in your blog site. For details, see `friends` in the [configuaration](./exampleSite/config.toml)

**Example**

```yaml
[params.friends]
feeds = ["https://xjj.pub/index.xml"]
topk = 3
title = "Friends' Posts"
```
