I’m Zhiyuan Ju, 25 years old (born in 1997), and live in China now. Here are my [blog](https://juzhiyuan.me/), [sharing](https://juzhiyuan.me/public-sharing), and [about me](https://juzhiyuan.me/about).

I have published 39 blog posts in Chinese since 2015, but I chose to start writing in English in May 2022, then I removed most Chinese content from this site. <3

Over the past few years, despite devoting more time to the open-source community, I still keep an eye on changes in the web space (technical, ecosystem, developer experience).

I enjoy the open-source spirit and community and continue to help and inspire the growth of the people around me. In the past 3 years:

1. I have communicated with more than 400 community users (individual and enterprise users), contributors, advocates, and others.
2. In addition to maintaining the relationship with users, I also iterate the feedback collected into the product or documentation.

This is not just what the product manager should do, IMO. I believe in and practice long-term and strive to reduce developers' onboard threshold and deposit valuable feedback.

### Highlights

1. Helped four non-computer majors find jobs by learning the Web.
2. Donate one M1 at my own expense to one of the Indian contributors to participate in the open-source community.
3. By continuously supporting community users, the [APISIX Slack channel](https://apisix.apache.org/slack) users have grown from 100 to 1,000+ organically.
4. While being a mentor in GSoC and OSPP activities, discover and guide three outstanding contributors to find their favored jobs.
5. From zero to one, complete the [API7.ai](https://api7.ai/) Global Team (Europe, India, Canada, Africa, and China) building in Q1 of 2022.
6. Responsible for the SEO optimization of the [APISIX website](https://apisix.apache.org/blog), optimizing keywords, output quality content, building internal links, and increasing backlinks with the team, achieving a 331% increase in visitors compared to last year (Oct 2021 ~ Oct 2022).
7. From zero to one, be responsible for maintaining the [APISIX Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard) project from 2019 to 2021 to help APISIX users get started with the product quickly.
8. Maintain the APISIX project and community with the [APISIX Team and contributors](https://apisix.apache.org/team), with nearly 500 contributors.

### Timeline

- In Sep 2015, I started my university journey. 👨‍🎓
- In 2016, I met many friends from university or offline events with the same passion for challenges.
- In 2017, I was involved in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) with [Miya Liu](https://twitter.com/miyaliu666) to host events and encourage people to learn Web technologies.
- In Mar 2018, I went to Frankfurt am Main as an exchange student.
- In July 2018, I interned as a web developer at Netease (a.k.a [163.com](http://163.com)).
- In late 2018, I started my first remote work as a full-stack web engineer in [Team247](https://www.theteam247.com/), a startup to build or maintain software for US clients (e.g., Visa, Bee On Demand). Even though I was still in university, the challenges and tasks were indeed for Senior Engineers. But I enjoyed this because I was not treated as an intern only but did things as other experienced engineers. So I learned a lot from here.
- In June 2019, I graduated from university and started as a full stack web engineer to build one stream media platform in the WeChat ecosystem. It’s super exciting to see many users watching videos on our platform, and we also got paid for ads.
- In July 2019, the [APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix) creators contacted me to check if I was interested in contributing to APISIX projects in my spare time. Of course! Then my story started from here. I summarize the story in the past 3 years into blogs: [My Story with the Apache Software Foundation](https://juzhiyuan.me/apache-software-foundation) and [Things worth sharing over the two years of startup](https://juzhiyuan.me/startup-story)
- Between May 2020 and Nov 2021, I acted as a community maintainer in the [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) community. To help beginners onboard, to highlight contributors to encourage them, to collect feedback from community users, to apply feedback as product/docs improvements, etc.
- Acted as a mentor in OSPP 2020 and 2021 to guide Chinese students to contribute to open-source projects.
- Acted as a mentor in GSoC 2020 and 2021 to guide global students onboard and learn from open source.
- Between Dec 2021 and today, I turned to focus on those things: Setting up Global Team in [API7.ai](https://api7.ai/), tracking potential customer leads from community users, supporting community users to use APISIX well, collecting feedback and applying improvements as before, to work with advocates on Developer Experience on Q4.
