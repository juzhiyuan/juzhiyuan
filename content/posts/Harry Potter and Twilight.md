I never thought Junjun would like to watch foreign movies ðŸŽ¬. In my impression, they are all palace dramas such as Empresses in the Palace and New Life Begins.

Twilight is something I knew since middle school. My deskmate at that time was particularly addicted to American dramas, such as Lost and Sherlock, and this is the first time I watched Twilight wholeheartedly: combining vampire and love stories, something I wasnâ€™t interested in during middle school.

Harry Potter is something I especially liked watching since childhood. Its background music and the scenes of each movie are vivid in my memory.

In addition to these, I recommend other movies such as Lord of the Rings, Narnia series, Marvel series, Disney series, Mission: Impossible series, etc.
