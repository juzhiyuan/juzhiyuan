Nearly every customer asks me: what values it compares to xxx? 

It’s a real user question that everyone will ask, if we try to understand the user’s real question and try to stand at user’s position, we will know why. 

Maybe they have load from internal team, maybe they need to finish their own work, maybe &#8230; There have many cases, but we need to know the real reason: to support them the best. To let users know clearly what the values are.
