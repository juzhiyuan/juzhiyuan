Today is the first day of 2023; I hope that this year, I will:

1. Gain knowledge: Read, listen to podcasts, watch YouTube (interviews, stories, etc.), and communicate with experienced people;

2. Be patient: Have patience towards work and life to make myself calmer;

3. Do more exercise: At the end of 2021, I exercised in the gym for a long time, and through the combination of diet, I successfully brought my weight back to below 140. I got a bit careless in 2022, and my weight increased. I need to complete the daily calorie check-in;

4. Be more focused: In my opinion, the team keywords of 2022 were `Exploration` and `Cooperation`. In 2023 I should focus on more important things.

Back in 2022, what did I do?

1. Set up and run the Global Team at [API7.ai](https://api7.ai).

2. Explore 10+ projects with the team and try, review, improve, and try.

3. Marry to Jun ðŸ’— We have known each other since 2015, and I love her deeply in the past, present, and future.

4. Experiencing [COVID virus](/covid-19) is not good, but we have overcome it.

5. On Dec 31, 2022, I enjoyed the day with Jun: watching movies (Puss in Boots 2, Avatar: The Way of Water), enjoying medium-Well steak, walk-in night, and first time attending a concert (Re-listen to the classic songs of each year in the past 22 years, it lasts from 22:30 to 00:30).
